# soul-tunes
An advanced music player that adapts to weather around you, mood, and many other factors. 

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

We were inspired by the Octave Group's challenge to make an enhanced music player.

<h2>What it does</h2>

Our music player, Soul Tunes, gives the user the option to search for an artist they wish to listen to and/or play music tailored to the weather conditions in the user's area. The playlists chosen for this purpose are intended to create a mood that complements the weather's effects on our feelings.

<h2>How we built it</h2>

We used Java and JavaFX to make a music player with a simple, yet functional graphical user interface. We also used the Spotify API to search for songs, and the OpenWeather API to fetch information about the weather in a certain area.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>

We had a lot of trouble connecting to the OpenWeather API, not to mention the collection of the data itself. Ultimately, we found a way around it.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

We are proud of the overall feel of the music player. The animated GIFs in the background bring the current weather conditions to life!

<h2>What we learned</h2>

Although we aren't experts with them, we learned how to work with APIs and practiced data parsing JSON files.

<h2>What's next for Soul Tunes</h2>

We had originally hoped to implement more features such as music for traffic conditions. Ideally, we would have liked to implement those and even make the GUI more appealing, but time was not a luxury. Another idea that comes to mind would be to integrate the applet into the web/cloud and make it accessible via nothing but an Internet connection and a browser.
